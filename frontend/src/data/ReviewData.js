				"Best burgers in town! We finally decided to try this place because we figured since the parking lot is always PACKED it must be good, and it did not disappoint! We both had the Fried Mac Burger with Waffle Sweets and it was so good we didn't even get a picture we ate so fast!! Great price for the quality & portions. They also had all the college football games on the tv's so the energy was great inside the restaurant! Super friendly staff as well! We will definitely be recommending this place and for sure will be back!",

				"Our neighbor told us about this place. We went to miracle park down the road with the kids and then stopped here for dinner. I had the dirty south burger and my husband had the brinner burger. It's the best burgers we've had since moving down here 9 years ago. Everything was delicious. The fries were seasoned so well! Very happy we found this spot.",

				"Probably one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Rock Hill. This meal on the other hand was lacking flavor. I wanted to try the birria tacos because it seems to be the trend now but they did not live up to the hype from this restaurant. They seems to just fall apart soon as you picked them up which made it difficult to eat. The meat on the inside was amazing though. I ended up just eating the meat out of the taco with the rice and queso. Maybe next time I'll just stick to my usual from this location. On the plus side their horchata is amazing there!",

				'Had dinner here. Located at the end of a strip mall, this festive looking Mexican restaurant looked appealing even if it is a small chain.. Located close to several hotels in walking distance as well. When we walked in we were promptly greeted. At 6pm the restaurant had a good crowd and the bar area was full. We elected to sit outside. We promptly received chips and salsa-3times. Mild, spicy and white. Waiter took our drink order and we had two grande Dos Equis drafts since we walked. DW ordered taco salad with chicken. I had mole enchiladas with chicken. Both were delicious with lots of chicken in the salad and the richness of the mole sauce rocking those enchiladas. We would eat here again!',

				"We just moved to Rock Hill, and we found our new Thai spot! They knocked it out of the park, every dish was so yummy. My husband ordered the chicken pad Thai spice level 4 and boy oh boy they brought the heat. He absolutely loved it! I ordered the Panang curry and it was so delicious. Best curry I've ever had. My sister in law ordered the Pad See Ew level 3 and she absolutely loved it. My son got the fried rice and he loved it. All hits all around. Everything was so fresh, crisp, and delicious. We will definitely be back... at least once a week!! Definitely a hidden gem, and the owners were so sweet. Such hard working and kind people. Everything about this place felt like home.",

				"Finally found a decent Thai restaurant that's a reasonable distance from where I live. Came here on a busy Friday night with my wife and we have always loved supporting small businesses. I was wondering why they had just two people working on such a busy night and found out it was a mother and son who work in the front of the house and the husband/father that cooks in the back. I can appreciate a small family-owned business who work hard, and you can definitely see the hard work they put into it. I got the Tom Yum soup and fried shrimp rolls and enjoyed both of them. For our dinner I ordered my usual cashew nut chicken, and she ordered the Pad See Ew. We also enjoyed both, however the portion size for her Pad See Ew was like ordering a lunch special or like ordering from a kid's menu. I understand that things are tough now, but noodles are not that expensive. We will most definitely come back and support them.",

				"This is a modest, retro-looking restaurant with great ratings in Rock Hill...and I've been here once a few years ago with my husband. I remember liking the food, but thinking it was way too spicy. I just remember using up several tissues to calm my eyes and nose. Thought I was going to die lol! Honestly, it's the intense spice level that scared me into not returning all these years. I tried to visit them a month ago, but it remained closed for indoor dining...and I'm not big on take-out or in-car dining (unless absolutely necessary). Anyway, this place is now finally open for indoor dining...so I swung in to try their Pad See Ew lunch special, which came with a choice of salad or soup...and an order of Thai Iced Tea. Though the Pad See Ew with Shrimp plate was rather small in portion, it was less than 12 bucks! So Yes, their lunch specials are super-affordable. Their Thai Iced Tea was also rather skimpy, but all-out delicious! This time, I clearly asked for a 3 out of 5 spice level, as in Medium Spicy...yet again, it was spicy as HELL. My nasal cavity nearly exploded, and I cried a little. OMG?? I really don't know if they offer dishes THIS spicy to everyone, or just to people like me that are Asian. I tend to think the latter...'cuz there is simply no WAY non-Asians can take this level of spice (if THIS hot at level 3)??? From ALL the Thai restaurants I've been to in Charlotte (and beyond) - and I've been to many Thai restaurants!! - the dishes I've had here have been the spiciest (even at level 3!). It's a shame 'cuz if they can modify the spice level, the dish would have been super delicious! BTW, despite how \"retro-looking\" the place may be, I did notice that they had an \"A\" sanitation grade! Also, their service was really good, and the food was freshly prepared and delivered quickly. Honestly, given their authencity and the convenient location, I would LOVE to give this restaurant all 5 stars...but each and every time, their spice level nearly kills me. I may give them one more try in the future...but next time, I'm going to go with 1 or 2 out of 5 spice level.",

				'Wow! We finally tried it tonight and we left with full bellies and smiles on our faces. I had the calabash shrimp, husband had Greek souvlaki dinner (wow) , and mom had chicken tenders. All of our food was delicious- but the standouts IMO were the fried squash and souvlaki dinner. Service was prompt and friendly- and we will definitely be back in the future!',

				'Empire Pizza is a fabulous addition to Mint Hill. We went there for an early dinner and sat on the patio. The patio is so nice. It has fans and TVs making it a great spot to hang out or watch a game. We ordered the pizza and wing special, garden salad, Buffalo chicken pizza, and mamas pizza. The garlic Parmesan wings were crispy and delicious. The pizza is thin crust, which is how I like it. Everything was soooo good and our service was perfect. There are also beers on tap to choose from. Empire pizza will see a lot of me in the future!',

				'Yummy southern food spot. The best fried squash that this country girl has ever had. They are known for their Greek cuisine. Their gyro plate is my go to. Tzatziki is spot in! Not crazy about their idea of a Greek salad dressing. Seemed more like a balsamic vinaigrette to me.',
